        by a dusting of cocoa or chocolate shavings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of mascarpone cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 cups strong brewed coffee or espresso, cooled</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
            <li>24-30 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate, grated or shaved (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and continue whisking constantly for about 8-10 minutes or until the mixture thickens and becomes pale in color. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Add the softened mascarpone cheese to the cooled egg mixture and whisk until smooth and well combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. Be careful not to overmix to maintain a light and airy texture.</li>
            <li>In a shallow dish, combine the cooled brewed coffee (or espresso) with the coffee liqueur if using.</li>
            <li>Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture briefly (don't soak them too long to avoid sogginess) and line the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish with a single layer of dipped ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, creating an even layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process by creating another layer of dipped ladyfingers on top of the mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li>Finish by spreading the remaining mascarpone mixture over the second layer of ladyfingers, smoothing it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust the top generously with unsweetened cocoa powder and sprinkle with grated or shaved dark chocolate for garnish.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the delicious homemade Tiramisu chilled. Enjoy the creamy, coffee-infused delight!</li>
